###  **üìçOSI Model**
    The open systems interconnection (OSI) model, a conceptual framework that enables disparate communication systems to exchange data via established protocols, was created by the International Organization for Standardization (IOS).
    The OSI, or Open Systems Interconnection, provides a standard for interoperability across different computer systems. 
    One could think of the OSI Model as a common language for computer networking.Its foundation is the idea that a communication system may be broken down into seven abstract levels, each one built on top of the previous.

###  **üìçTCP/IP Model**
    The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model is referred to as the TCP/IP model.
    This model is a component of the network domain created especially to monitor effective and error-free data transfer.
