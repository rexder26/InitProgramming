> ## 1. Text

    The idea and practice of automating the creation or modification of electronic text is referred to as text processing in computing. Text typically refers to all of the alphanumeric characters that are available on the user's keyboard, but in general, text refers to the abstraction layer that comes right before the target text's default character encoding. Processing is used to describe automatic (or mechanized) manipulation rather than the same manipulation done manually.
